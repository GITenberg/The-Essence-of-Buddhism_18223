<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>I am glad to be permitted thus to say, in a few words of introduction
to this well-meditated little volume, how pleasant and how profitable
an idea it must be considered to have designed and compiled a Buddhist
anthology. Selecting his cut and uncut jewels from very various
Buddhistic sources, Mr. Bowden has here supplied those who buy and use
the book with rubies and sapphires and emeralds of wisdom, compassion,
and human brotherhood, any one of which, worn on the heart, would be
sufficient to make the wearer rich beyond estimation for a day. The
author disclaims any attempt to set forth a corpus of Buddhistic
morality and doctrine, nor, indeed, would anything of the kind be
possible within such narrow limits; but I rejoice to observe how well
and faithfully his manifold extracts from the Sacred Books of India
and the East exhibit that ever-pervading tenderness of the great
Asiatic Teacher, which extended itself to all alike that live. This
compassionateness of Gautama, if nothing else had been illustrated by
the collection, would render it precious to possess and fruitful to
employ; but many another lofty tenet of the "Light" of Asia finds
illumination in some brief verse or maxim as day after day glides by;
and he who should mark the passage of the months with these simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>pages must become, I think, a better man at the year's end than at
its beginning. I recommend this compilation without hesitation or
reserve.</p>

<h2><a name="COMPILERS_PROEM" id="COMPILERS_PROEM"></a>COMPILER'S PROEM.</h2>

<h3>E. M. BOWDEN.</h3>
<p>In this compilation no attempt has been made to present a general view
of Buddhism as a religious or philosophical system. The aim has rather
been to turn Buddhism to account as a moral force by bringing together
a selection of its beautiful sentiments, and lofty maxims, and
particularly including some of those which inculcate mercy to the
lower animals.</p>

<p>On this point a far higher stand is taken by Buddhism than by
Christianity&mdash;or at any rate than by Christianity as understood and
interpreted by those who ought to know. Not only is the whole question
of our duties to the lower animals commonly ignored in Christian works
as, for instance, in the famous Imitation of Christ, and scores of
others; but, as if this were not enough, a reasoned attempt has
actually been made, on the strength of Christian teaching, to explode
the notion that animals have any right (e.g., in Moral Philosophy, by
Father Joseph Rickaby). Very different in this respect is the tone of
the average Buddhist treatise, with its earnest exhortations,
recurring as a matter of course, to show mercy on every living thing;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>and this difference alone is an adequate reason for compiling a
Buddhist anthology.</p>

<p>In regard to the sources quoted from, considerable latitude seemed
allowable. They do not all, by any means, possess canonical authority.
But they are all distinctly Buddhist in character. The supposed dates
of the originals range from at least the third century B. C. to
medieval and later times.</p>

<p>Hence, it is clear that, should any one think to make use of
quotations from this work for controversial purposes, a certain degree
of caution will be necessary. The context of the passage, and the date
and the authorship of the original work, may all need to be taken into
account; while it must also be borne in mind that the religious terms,
such as "heaven" and "sin," which have to be employed in English, do
not always correspond exactly to the Buddhist conception.</p>

<p>Of the numerous Buddhist works which have now been translated from
some eight or ten eastern languages, the greater number, when regarded
purely as literature, occupy a very low level. At times they are so
remarkably dull and silly that the reader is inclined to ask why they
were ever translated. But the one redeeming feature in the voluminous
compositions of Buddhist writers is the boundless compassion which
they consistently inculcate.</p>

<p>The insertion of a passage in these pages does not necessarily imply
that the compiler accepts in its entirety the teaching it conveys.
Concerning that oft-repeated injunction, not to kill any living
creature whatsoever, we can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> hardly doubt that there are many cases in
which to take life, provided it is taken painlessly, not only is not
on the whole an unkindness, but is an act of beneficence. If we
sometimes give to this injunction the sense of extending our sympathy
to the lowest sentient being, and not causing pain to living creatures
while they live, we shall perhaps not be doing violence to the spirit
of mercy by which it was prompted. There are many passages in Buddhist
works which advocate preference for the spirit over the letter, or the
exercise of judgment in accepting what we are taught.</p>

<p>A few passages, though not many, have been included more because they
are striking or poetical than for the sake of their moral teaching.</p>

<p>As the references given are mostly to the Oriental origins, it is only
fair to insert here a list of the English and French translations
which have been principally used in compiling this book. The following
works comprise most of those which have proved directly of service for
the purpose&mdash;"Sacred Books of the East," namely:</p>

<p>No decrying of other sects, ... no depreciation (of others) without

whatever cause honor is due. By so doing, both one's sect will be
helped forward, and other sects benefited; by acting otherwise, one's
own sect will be destroyed in injuring others.&mdash;Rock Inscriptions of

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
